## üöÄ Running the Project

### Production Build (For Teacher Review)
A production build is included in the repository for easy review:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd authpls
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

The production build is already included in the `.next` directory, so there's no need to run `npm run build`.

### Development Mode
To run the project in development mode:

1. Follow steps 1-3 above
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
